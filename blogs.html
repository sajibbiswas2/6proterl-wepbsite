                Answer: var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let. An example will clarify the difference even better...</p>

                    Answer :This article discusses the major differences between the regular functions and the arrow functions. Arrow functions a new feature introduced in ES6 enable writing concise functions in JavaScript. While both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences between them, as discussed below.</p>

                        Answer:.forEach: .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. Example: In the example below we would use .forEach() to iterate over an array of food and log that we would want to eat each of them.
                        
                        .map(): .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. Example: In the example below we would use .map to iterate over the elements of the cost array and divide each element by 10, then assign our new array containing the new cost to the variable
                        
                        .filter(): .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. Example: In the example below we would use .filter to return values that are less than 200.
                        
                        find() The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.

                            Answer :Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</p>
